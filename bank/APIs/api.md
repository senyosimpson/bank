# Application Programming Interface

An Application Programming Interface (API) is an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. It provides a set of definitions and protocols for developers to interface with. This allows them to communicate with products and services without having to know the implementation details of the code itself. Some of the advantages of APIs are

* Allows for easier integration of products and services into your systems 
* Provides a layer of security as it is simple to set up permissions to certain resources and the code itself is not public facing
* Control over what information is shared/returned by the 

A simple analogy for understanding an API is given by How-to-Geek. "Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to."

This summarises how an API is used. As a developer, you have knowledge of what you can request and what those requests return. The logic is hidden in the API and is 'irrelevant' from the user perspective. A great use case on the rise that leverages APIs is open banking by companies such as (Plaid)[https://plaid.com] and [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com).
