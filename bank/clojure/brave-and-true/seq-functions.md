# Sequence Functions

Sequence functions are functions that operate on sequences (seq). Lists, vectors, sets and maps amongst others all fall into sequences.

## map

Map is a way to apply a function to every element within a sequence

```clojure
(map inc [1 2 3])
; => 2 3 4
```

## reduce

## take-while and drop-while

## filter

## some

## sort

## concat

## Lazy Sequences

## Infinite Sequences

## Functions over functions

### Partial

### Apply
