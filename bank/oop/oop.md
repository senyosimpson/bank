# Object-oriented Programming

Object-oriented is a programming paradigm based on objects which are data structures that include both data and functions that can be applied to those functions. The object-oriented paradigm is arguably the most popular programming paradigm, made so by its use in enterprise languages such as Java and C++. It also has the benefit of being a natural way of thinking. Take for instance a house. A house is an object that consists of many other objects such as a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom etc which also contain other objects such as a toilet, bed, table etc. These are all well defined in object-oriented programming and can have functions attached to them for processing the data they contain. For instance, a toilet might have a flush function which flushes the toilet and updates the number of flushes performed in a day. Object-oriented programming has four core tenets - encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.

## Encapsulation

## Abstraction

## Inheritance

## Polymorphism
